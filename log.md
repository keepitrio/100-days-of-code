### Day 2

**Today's Progress**: Tried to update Sketchpad project by using HTML canvas tag. 

**Thoughts** Currently stuck and confused about how to create an event and callback function where clicking and dragging within the canvas will draw a line.

### Day 3

**Today's Progress**: I worked on a simple project, a form to enter username and password. 

**Thoughts** I still need to make some changes to my JS file so that the second password entered is compared to first to make sure they match. I want to make some more style changes too. Took a break from sketchpad.
