# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 11

**Today's Progress**: Didn't make too much progress today. Created an array of arrays of objects. Each object is a panel, there are 5 panels per array within the array. I'll need to create a function that chooses a random array when the space button is clicked, then I'll need to create an h1 and p in each panel and put the text in the panel. 

**Thoughts**: It's definitely a lot harder to get things done when working a full time job. Progress is slow but I will get there. 

### Day 10

**Today's Progress**: I continued to work on my copy of the coolers.co page. I added a nav bar with styling. Right now, the "More" droptown is activated when you click on it. I want to change it by using Javascript so the dropdown menu will remain opened after I click on "More". Once I click on "More" again, the dropdown menu should disappear.

**Thoughts** Styling looks pretty close to the original. I still have to work on the arrays within an array with different sets of colors for when you press the space bar. 

### Day 9

**Today's Progress**: Worked more on copying coolers.co. I made the divs in HTML and styled them with colors in my CSS file. Next I'll want to create a sticky nav bar in HTML. I will create an array of arrays of objects in my JS file and create a function that will choose one of the arrays randomly when the space button is pressed and display the color of the name, the Hex code, as well as change the color of the panel to the Hex color. 

**Thoughts** Also noticed a bug in my Sketchpad project. When you click on clear, the next time you try to draw in the sketchpad, if you let go of the mouse while drawing, it will draw a line the next time you click on your mouse in a different location. It seems like clicking on CLEAR clears changes I've made when I saw this was happening with the color button. Maybe I'll just need to copy and paste that same code for the CLEAR button. 

Moving forward, I've decided to focus on one question a week that I want to get answered and log the answer to. This week's question is, "What style of company would I want to work at?" In order to answer this question, I will think about what I value in in the work I accomplish.

### Day 8

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my username and password JS file but function is not working as I want it to.. will need to revisit later.

### Day 7

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my username and password page today. Tried to alter the JS so that when the submit button is clicked, there would be an alert when passwords don't match. Code looks rght but for some reason, the input values are not being stored in the variables I created. I'll need to revisit this another day. 

**Thoughts** Everything looks right, but it's not working. What happening here? 

### Day 6

**Today's Progress**: My "doing" time will mainly consist of copying websites and practicing string manipulation and other little exercises like that. Today I started copying one of my favorite websites, coolers.co. It will have the basic functionality of clicking on Space button to get a new set of colors. Today I used JS to create the divs that will contain the colors when Space button is pressed. 

**Thoughts** Why aren't my CSS styles showing? I'm missing something here...


### Day 5

**Today's Progress**: Today I made the clear button work, but the previous drawing would reappear when I clicked in the canvas again. To fix this, I had to set clickX and clickY to new arrays so it cleared the array.

I also worked on the random color button. When you click on this button, you'll get a random color from an array of 5 colors. The only problem with this is that it changes any previous drawing to that color as well. Ideally, I'd want the previous colors to remain, but that's for another day. 

**Thoughts** I felt great about my progress today. Little steps, but getting there.


### Day 4

**Today's Progress**: Back to my sketchpad project, I fixed my JS to be able to draw on canvas. Next, I'll need to write a function for the clear button. 

**Thoughts** Today was a little frustrating trying to figure out why my JS wasn't working. I'm getting a better grip on how event handling and callback functions work, so I'm excited to work on the clear button, which will be what I work on next time. 


### Day 3

**Today's Progress**: I worked on a simple project, a form to enter username and password. 

**Thoughts** I still need to make some changes to my JS file so that the second password entered is compared to first to make sure they match. I want to make some more style changes too. Took a break from sketchpad.


### Day 2

**Today's Progress**: Tried to update Sketchpad project by using HTML canvas tag. 

**Thoughts** Currently stuck and confused about how to create an event and callback function where clicking and dragging within the canvas will draw a line.
