# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1

**Today's Progress**: Started Sketchpad project from the Odin Project

**Thoughts:** Made a function that creates divs, creating a grid

### Day 2

**Today's Progress**: Tried to update Sketchpad project by using HTML canvas tag. 

**Thoughts** Currently stuck and confused about how to create an event and callback function where clicking and dragging within the canvas will draw a line.

### Day 3

**Today's Progress**: I worked on a simple project, a form to enter username and password. 

**Thoughts** I still need to make some changes to my JS file so that the second password entered is compared to first to make sure they match. I want to make some more style changes too. Took a break from sketchpad.

### Day 4

**Today's Progress**: Back to my sketchpad project, I fixed my JS to be able to draw on canvas. Next, I'll need to write a function for the clear button. 

**Thoughts** Today was a little frustrating trying to figure out why my JS wasn't working. I'm getting a better grip on how event handling and callback functions work, so I'm excited to work on the clear button, which will be what I work on next time. 

### Day 5

**Today's Progress**: Today I made the clear button work, but the previous drawing would reappear when I clicked in the canvas again. To fix this, I had to set clickX and clickY to new arrays so it cleared the array.

I also worked on the random color button. When you click on this button, you'll get a random color from an array of 5 colors. The only problem with this is that it changes any previous drawing to that color as well. Ideally, I'd want the previous colors to remain, but that's for another day. 

**Thoughts** I felt great about my progress today. Little steps, but getting there.

### Day 6

**Today's Progress**: My "doing" time will mainly consist of copying websites and practicing string manipulation and other little exercises like that. Today I started copying one of my favorite websites, coolers.co. It will have the basic functionality of clicking on Space button to get a new set of colors. Today I used JS to create the divs that will contain the colors when Space button is pressed. 

**Thoughts** Why aren't my CSS styles showing? I'm missing something here...
