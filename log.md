# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 31

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Binary Search Tree and practiced implementing it in Ruby.

**Thoughts**:
* I'm feeling comfortable understanding data structures and how they work, but I have more trouble implementing them.

### Day 22-30

**Today's Progress**: Today we worked on client projects. Our project was to create an app where students and admins have different capabilities. students can log in and add pitches, then vote on the pitches. Admins can control when students can add pitches or vote on pitches for 2 different rounds. 

**Thoughts**:
* Today was tougher than I expected. I was trying to create a nested form in a nested route, but the two were not related. Nested route was a vote form for different rounds, so the path would be round/1/votes. The nested form was for pitches in a specific round, which was a many to many relationship. I want to display the pitches that are available for the round, but the post request would be going to the votes controller and saving a vote to the database, with the round id and the pitch id. 


### Day 21

**Today's Progress**: This week we're doing JavaScript in three days. Monday is plain JavaScript, Tuesday is jQuery, and Wednesday is AJAX. Today we practiced writing prototype functions, object literals, solving algorithms in javascript, and also continued to get Active Record assocation practice.

**Thoughts**: Today was tough for me. I had migraines in the morning. I felt horrible for my pair because I felt like I was slowing us down since I was having trouble thinking. During lunch, I went out for a walk and I felt a whole lot better afterwards. We managed to complete all of the challenges for the day and I am feeling pretty comfortable with javascript. 

### Day 15 - 20

**Today's Progress**: Writing for end of week 2 and week 3 of phase 1 at DBC. We continued to study classes and inheritence, started some SQL in combination with Ruby, and started Active Records. 

**Thoughts**: It's crazy to look back at day 1 of DBC and to see how far I've come. I can explain concepts that I was unclear of on day 1, and can solve problems I wouldn't have been able to before. I was freaking out before the assessment but felt confident and comfortable with the material on assessment day. I've passed and am moving onto phase 2. I'm scared but super excited.


### Day 14

**Today's Progress**: Did a little reading from Object Oriented Design in Ruby by Sandi Metz and reviewed my cohortmate's code and did some refactoring. 

**Thoughts**: While I was at HelloSign, I got the opportunity to shadow a full stack engineer on board, and a lot of his time was spent reviewing code. Some companies do some reviewing, but HelloSign (for both compliance and best practice reasons) reviews every line of code that's written. During that time, I came to fully understand the importance of reviewing code. Today I was able to read through somebody's code, explain what it does, pseudocode the whole thing, and refactor it. 

### Day 13

**Today's Progress**: Worked on roman numerals challenge again, from Monday. This time I was able to fully understand the recursive version and implement the edge case of modern roman numerals.

**Thoughts**: I should've started recording this info from the beginning of phase 0, but better late than never. This will be a good way to keep track of my thoughts during DBC. After a week of DBC, it's amazing how much I've solidified my understanding of topics that were previously so foreign to me. I'm feeling a lot more confident about everything, but I want to practice more, especially algorithms. We're starting OOP next week and I'm excited. We watched a video on mixins and class inheritence. The video really helped me understand how classes inherit methods and how modules will become a class's immediate ancestor if it is mixed into the class. 

### Day 12

**Today's Progress**: Started a course on https://learn.co. Just trying to jog my brain before DBC starts on 5/8/17. Working through JavaScript basics, testing loops.

**Thoughts**: I fell off the radar.. Felt pretty lazy and unmotivated lately, but finally got myself together this weekend and trying to get back into the habit of studying and doing things consistently.


### Day 11

**Today's Progress**: Didn't make too much progress today. Created an array of arrays of objects. Each object is a panel, there are 5 panels per array within the array. I'll need to create a function that chooses a random array when the space button is clicked, then I'll need to create an h1 and p in each panel and put the text in the panel. 

**Thoughts**: It's definitely a lot harder to get things done when working a full time job. Progress is slow but I will get there. 

### Day 10

**Today's Progress**: I continued to work on my copy of the coolers.co page. I added a nav bar with styling. Right now, the "More" droptown is activated when you click on it. I want to change it by using Javascript so the dropdown menu will remain opened after I click on "More". Once I click on "More" again, the dropdown menu should disappear.

**Thoughts** Styling looks pretty close to the original. I still have to work on the arrays within an array with different sets of colors for when you press the space bar. 

### Day 9

**Today's Progress**: Worked more on copying coolers.co. I made the divs in HTML and styled them with colors in my CSS file. Next I'll want to create a sticky nav bar in HTML. I will create an array of arrays of objects in my JS file and create a function that will choose one of the arrays randomly when the space button is pressed and display the color of the name, the Hex code, as well as change the color of the panel to the Hex color. 

**Thoughts** Also noticed a bug in my Sketchpad project. When you click on clear, the next time you try to draw in the sketchpad, if you let go of the mouse while drawing, it will draw a line the next time you click on your mouse in a different location. It seems like clicking on CLEAR clears changes I've made when I saw this was happening with the color button. Maybe I'll just need to copy and paste that same code for the CLEAR button. 

Moving forward, I've decided to focus on one question a week that I want to get answered and log the answer to. This week's question is, "What style of company would I want to work at?" In order to answer this question, I will think about what I value in in the work I accomplish.

### Day 8

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my username and password JS file but function is not working as I want it to.. will need to revisit later.

### Day 7

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my username and password page today. Tried to alter the JS so that when the submit button is clicked, there would be an alert when passwords don't match. Code looks rght but for some reason, the input values are not being stored in the variables I created. I'll need to revisit this another day. 

**Thoughts** Everything looks right, but it's not working. What happening here? 

### Day 6

**Today's Progress**: My "doing" time will mainly consist of copying websites and practicing string manipulation and other little exercises like that. Today I started copying one of my favorite websites, coolers.co. It will have the basic functionality of clicking on Space button to get a new set of colors. Today I used JS to create the divs that will contain the colors when Space button is pressed. 

**Thoughts** Why aren't my CSS styles showing? I'm missing something here...


### Day 5

**Today's Progress**: Today I made the clear button work, but the previous drawing would reappear when I clicked in the canvas again. To fix this, I had to set clickX and clickY to new arrays so it cleared the array.

I also worked on the random color button. When you click on this button, you'll get a random color from an array of 5 colors. The only problem with this is that it changes any previous drawing to that color as well. Ideally, I'd want the previous colors to remain, but that's for another day. 

**Thoughts** I felt great about my progress today. Little steps, but getting there.


### Day 4

**Today's Progress**: Back to my sketchpad project, I fixed my JS to be able to draw on canvas. Next, I'll need to write a function for the clear button. 

**Thoughts** Today was a little frustrating trying to figure out why my JS wasn't working. I'm getting a better grip on how event handling and callback functions work, so I'm excited to work on the clear button, which will be what I work on next time. 


### Day 3

**Today's Progress**: I worked on a simple project, a form to enter username and password. 

**Thoughts** I still need to make some changes to my JS file so that the second password entered is compared to first to make sure they match. I want to make some more style changes too. Took a break from sketchpad.


### Day 2

**Today's Progress**: Tried to update Sketchpad project by using HTML canvas tag. 

**Thoughts** Currently stuck and confused about how to create an event and callback function where clicking and dragging within the canvas will draw a line.

### Day 1

**Today's Progress**: Started Sketchpad project from the Odin Project

**Thoughts:** Made a function that creates divs, creating a grid
